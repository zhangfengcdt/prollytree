//! Internal tracing utilities for conditional debug and trace logging.
//!
//! This module provides macros that conditionally compile logging statements
//! based on the presence of test, tracing, or prod-logging features.

// Note: These macros are currently unused but kept for potential future use.
// They provide a pattern for conditional compilation of logging statements.

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_placeholder() {
        // Placeholder test to ensure the module compiles
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
