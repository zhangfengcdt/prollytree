# Enhanced Financial Advisor - Detailed Guide

Sophisticated, memory-driven system utilizing the full ProllyTree agent memory abstraction with multi-step AI workflows, behavioral learning, and complex financial analysis.

## Core Enhancements

- **Complete Agent Memory Integration**: Utilizes all four memory types (short-term, semantic, episodic, procedural) from `src/agent`
- **Multi-Step Workflow Engine**: Complex analysis pipelines that leverage memory for context and learning
- **Deep Personalization**: Client-specific adaptations based on behavioral patterns and interaction history
- **Advanced AI Integration**: Enhanced Rig framework usage with contextual memory-driven prompts
- **Learning and Adaptation**: System learns from recommendation outcomes to improve future advice

## Architecture Components

### 1. Enhanced Memory Schema (`src/memory/enhanced_types.rs`)
Financial-specific data structures for comprehensive memory storage:

- **ClientEntity**: Rich client profiles with risk evolution tracking
- **MarketEntity**: Comprehensive market data with analyst ratings
- **RecommendationEpisode**: Detailed recommendation history with outcomes
- **AnalysisWorkflow**: Procedural knowledge for multi-step analysis
- **ComplianceRule**: Automated compliance checking and validation

### 2. Workflow Processor (`src/advisor/workflow.rs`)

```rust
pub async fn execute_recommendation_workflow(
    &mut self,
    symbol: &str,
    client_id: &str,
) -> Result<DetailedRecommendation>
```

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Initialize analysis context with client memory
2. Market research using semantic and episodic memory
3. Risk analysis with historical pattern recognition
4. Compliance validation with automated rule checking
5. Personalized recommendation generation
6. Learning outcome storage for future improvement

### 3. Analysis Modules (`src/advisor/analysis_modules.rs`)
Specialized analysis components:

- **MarketResearchModule**: Comprehensive market analysis with AI insights
- **RiskAnalysisModule**: Multi-dimensional risk assessment
- **ComplianceModule**: Automated regulatory compliance checking
- **RecommendationModule**: Personalized recommendation generation

### 4. Personalization Engine (`src/advisor/personalization.rs`)
Advanced client behavior modeling and adaptation:

- **ClientBehaviorModel**: Tracks decision patterns, risk evolution, communication preferences
- **PersonalizationInsights**: AI-driven adaptation strategies
- **Memory-Driven Learning**: Continuous improvement from client interactions

### 5. Enhanced Financial Advisor (`src/advisor/enhanced_advisor.rs`)
Main coordinator that brings everything together:

```rust
pub struct EnhancedFinancialAdvisor {
    memory_system: Arc<AgentMemorySystem>,
    workflow_processor: WorkflowProcessor,
    analysis_modules: AnalysisModuleRegistry,
    rig_client: Option<Client>,
}
```
